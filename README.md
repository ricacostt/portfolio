## Welcome to my Portfolio Project!

I am a recent graduate of a 16-week software development bootcamp and this project is a showcase of my skills and passion in the world of software development and UX Design. As an avid learner and passionate problem-solver, I have poured my heart into creating an elegant, simple and accessible page to allow a seamless user experience.

Whether you're a fellow developer, a potential employer, or simply someone who appreciates great software, I invite you to explore my projects and see the results of my hard work and dedication.
 
If you have any questions or comments along the way, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am always happy to connect with like-minded individuals and share my passion for technology with the world.
