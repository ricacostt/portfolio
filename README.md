## Welcome to my Portfolio Project!

I am a recent graduate of a 16-week software development bootcamp and this project is a showcase of my skills and passion in the world of software development and UX Design. As an avid learner and passionate problem-solver, I have poured my heart into creating an elegant, simple and accessible page to allow a seamless user experience.

Whether you're a fellow developer, a potential employer, or simply someone who appreciates great software, I invite you to explore my projects and see the results of my dedication.
 
If you have any questions or comments along the way, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am always happy to connect share my passion for technology.
