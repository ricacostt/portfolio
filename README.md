## Welcome to my Portfolio Project!

I am a recent graduate of a 16-week software development bootcamp and this project is a showcase of my skills and passion in the world of software development and UX Design. As an avid learner and passionate problem-solver, I have poured my heart into creating an elegant, simple and accessible page to allow a seamless user experience.
